# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Idea:
Lock an amount of Ethereum (or any other token) to the contract, and send a message to the contract in a sepicific time interval. If the message is not sent, the smart contract will automatically dispatch the amount to a specified address. (If the owner of the account dies, or something happens to him/her, the contract will pay his deposited amount to an address specified by him, after an amount of time specified by him.)
